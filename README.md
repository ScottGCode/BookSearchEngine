# Book Search Engine 

## Description

As an avid reader I want to search for new books to read so that I can keep a list of books to purchase. I took a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This made this application more performant beause websites are driven by two things: data and user demands and user demands are constantly evolving. This app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
